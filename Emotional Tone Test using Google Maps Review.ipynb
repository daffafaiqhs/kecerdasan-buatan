    "The Emotional Tone Test using Google Maps Reviews is an innovative application of sentiment analysis technology aimed at gauging the emotional nuances embedded within user-generated reviews on the platform. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, this test aims to uncover the underlying emotional tones—such as postive, negati, or neutral by reviewers when sharing their experiences at BROOKLYN MUESEUM, NY. Bellow is attached the test review for this case."

Usually they give a SUGGESTED amount but when I went with my class (mind you I’m in college) they made us pay $16 to go into the frida khalo exhibit with a student discount even though it is A SUGGESTED amount... meaning we did not all have to pay $16 each to go into that lame exhibit. We could have paid $1 and still gotten in. This was by far the worst experience ever because they kept telling us we HAD to pay that amount and never told us it was just a donation which is NOT MANDATORY to give. All in all, the frida khalo exhibit was pretty good but not worth the regular SUGGESTED price nor the student discount SUGGESTED price. We couldn’t take photos in the exhibit and for that why even pay if we can’t take photos in the exhibit? It totally isn’t worth the money or time even going. I love fridas stuff but they just gave horrible customer service and was very stressful to many students which ARE PAYING FOR COLLEGE! it was unfortunate as well how staff kept screaming at us to not take photos at the exhibit meanwhile we paid to go in there for a reason. Long story short, I took photos. And they’re the ones below. Enjoy!:)\n",

I went to this museum with a coworker and 6 young kids (we work at an afterschool/camp). We were let in without a problem but after spending an hour observing the exhibits, I was approached by a security guard who informed me that we should be careful. He said other security guards may give us a hard time because the children had backpacks (not bulky ones I may add) and we are supposed to bring them to bag check . After telling me this my coworker and I decided it's best to leave. The first security guard then proceeded to tell a female security guard about us and she then followed us into the elevator and out to the lobby (practically escorting us out). She then said something to front desk about us as we left. Not only was it disrespectful, (considering we were not aware of the rules/ were NOT told when getting the tickets) the kids also felt very uncomfortable. If we were made aware of the problem with bags we would have gladly gave then to bag check. So unprofessional.\n",

Do you know the security guard refused us? He turned away a little boy who had to use the restroom! What is that!?!? Is this not a place for Brooklynites to freely come and freely go and feel welcome?? This was an unusual request, I’m sure, but how does one turn away a child.
